# Scholarly App

## Overview

Scholarly is a Windows application designed to streamline the process of managing scholarships and academic awards for the Midwestern State University (MSU) Department of Computer Science. The app provides functionality for the scholarship committee to efficiently filter and evaluate student data, generate personalized scholarship award letters, and create polls for the selection of Outstanding Student Award candidates. It allows for easy importation of student application data from CSV files, and helps facilitate the approval process for scholarships and awards.

The primary user of Scholarly is the Chair of the MSU Computer Science Scholarship Committee. Scholarly does not include students or applicants as users, but instead focuses on helping the committee make decisions by simplifying data filtering, award letter generation, and voting processes. 

Scholarly is a self-contained system and does not rely on integration with other larger systems, offering a dedicated solution to MSUâ€™s scholarship and award selection processes.
